TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game\n<p>Whether or not you like American football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There is always a little something for everyone. For the die-hard fans, there is the game itself with blowouts, comebacks, and controversy. For the not so die-hard fans, there are the ridiculously expensive ads that are hilarious, gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and sometimes weird. And of course, there are the halftime shows with the biggest musicians in the world entertaining us by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=14\">riding a giant mechanical tiger</a> or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62\">leaping from the roof of the stadium</a>.

Do blowouts translate to lost viewers?\n<p>The vast majority of Super Bowls are close games. Makes sense. Both teams are the best in their conference if they've made it this far. The closest game ever was the Buffalo Bills' 1-point loss to the New York Giants in 1991, which is best remembered for Scott Norwood's last-second missed field goal attempt that went <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPFZCGgjDSg\">wide right</a></em>, kicking off four Bills Super Bowl losses in a row. Poor Scott. The biggest point spread so far is 45 points (!) when Hall of Famer, Joe Montana, led the San Francisco 49ers to victory in 1990, one year before the closest game ever.</p>\n<p>I remember watching the Seahawks crush the Broncos by 35 points (43-8) in 2014, which was a boring experience in my opinion. The game was never really close. I'm pretty sure we changed the channel at the end of the third quarter. Let's combine the game data and TV data to see if this is a universal phenomenon.
